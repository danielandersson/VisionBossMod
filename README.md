## About

VisionBossMod is a Boss/Guild Addon for the MMORPG World of Warcraft. VBM (VisionBossMod) strives 
to be a no frills addon allowing you to kill bosses effectively. Despite the fact that VBM will not 
have a bar for every single boss ability, you can rest assured that it will still hold your hand 
throughout the fight.
